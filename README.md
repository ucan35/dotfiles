# Dotfiles

My configuration files.

## Getting Started

This repository is a ~~bare~~ _yadm_ git repository. See <https://yadm.io/>.

I used to manage bare repository by myself, but then i accidentally ran `git clean -fdx` and i went mad.  
The technique that was used before can be found [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).

### Prerequisites

Yadm and/or git.

### Installing

See yadm manual, or clone this repository straight with git. That's it.
